## 2026-10-30 01:55: task 1, test hooks: DONE code-only, wip/test-hooks 0019e8a (not merged)
- `-place tree:<species>` now faces the trunk. New `-place ledge`: to the nearest settlement, then (once props' tops
  load) on level ground 1.5 m in front of the nearest rim the body can mantle (about 1-1.8 m for a human), facing it.
- `-autowalk` with either: 12 s at the trunk or over the rim (jumping near a rim), 8 s back, repeating every 20 s.
- Both log `DebugControls: climb test: ...` with the trunk/rim position and ready `-goto`/`-camlook` client flags.
- Not compiled or run by me (no editor slot); the profiler builds and runs `-body Monkey -place tree:Oak -autowalk`
  and `-place ledge -autowalk`. Merge to animal-behaviours after both pass.
- NEXT: task 2 (Brain.Sample marker plus a moving count), code-only.
